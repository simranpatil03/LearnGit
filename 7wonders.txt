The 7 Wonders Of The World

Periodically, sparks of genius alight in humanity, and a monument to attaining the impossible is born. The New7Wonders Foundation has assembled a list of these incredible feats, which emulate the original "Ancient 7 Wonders of the World" to highlight still-standing structures. Even at face value, each of these works-of-art embodies the raw passion and drive it took to create these engineering legends. Their stories and physical remnants have survived thousands of years, and these tales are now ready to be told again: to you.
